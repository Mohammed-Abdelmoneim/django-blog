## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

A Django-powered blog application that supports post publishing, tagging, and user comments. It features a simple and clean interface for reading blog posts, as well as a search system, pagination and share a post via email. Posts are stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the app includes an admin panel for content management.

## <a name="tech-stack">‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</a>

- **[Django](https://djangoproject.com/)** is a free and open-source, high-level Python web framework that facilitates the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation. 

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** (for PostgreSQL) is used to containerize the PostgreSQL database, ensuring easy setup, portability, and consistency across development environments.

- **[Django Taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is a simple and flexible tagging library for Django. It allows users to associate tags with blog posts and supports tag-based filtering and suggestions.

- **[PostgreSQL Full-Text Search](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** This feature enables powerful search functionality using PostgreSQL‚Äôs built-in indexing and ranking system. It's integrated into the blog to provide fast and accurate search results based on post content.

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Abdelmoneim/django-blog

```

**Set Up a Virtual Environment**


```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

**Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start PostgreSQL with Docker**

Make sure you have Docker installed and running. Then run:

```bash
docker run --name blog-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=bloguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=blogpass -e POSTGRES_DB=blogdb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```
**Configure Environment Variables**

Create a <code>.env</code> file in the project root (or set variables directly) with:

```ini
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=My Blog <your-email@gmail.com>
DB_NAME=blog
DB_USER=blog
DB_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
DB_HOST=localhost

```
Update <code>settings.py</code> to read from .env (optional but recommended).

**Apply Migrations**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**Create a Superuser (Admin)**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Run the Development Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to view the project.
